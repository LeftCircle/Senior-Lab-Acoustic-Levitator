Current goals:

1.) Account for directionality of the transducer

- I am not sure if we should place the transducers at x/y == 0 but then put them at their appropriate z heights. 

- Currently there is an issue accessing data to get the T matrix and some of the other things for the matrix method. But once this is sorted out it, hopefully everything will fall in place and we will be done! It took less than 15 lines of code to actually do the matrix method before (without directionality), and we are in a similar place as we were before in the sense that all of the data is there but we just have to access it somehow.

2.) Figure out real values for initial conditions
